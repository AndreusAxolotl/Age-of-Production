One day I asked myself: "Space Age adds so much! But why do I still have to smelt bricks the good old way?"
After that, I found Hurricane's amazing textures and I decided that I'd have made a mod!

Two months later, here we are! My first true mod!

# Age of Production

This mod adds 18 new buildings, many new recipes, 3 new fluids and a couple new items!

My philosophy with this mod was: Add stuff to Space Age without adding new planets.

Should be safe to add in an already started save!

The new additions, per planet, are:

# Vulcanus:
- Arc Furnace: an electric furnace that is bigger, better, faster and stronger! A good 50% productivity never hurt anyone! (Unlocked after Metallurgic Science)
- Smeltery: This highly advanced foundry can reach unthinkable temperatures, allowing for interesting new applications! From calcite-less molten metal to melting metallic intermediates, this machine may be helpful when in need of a reliable source of metal! Only 25% prod tho! (Unlocked after Quantum Processors)
- Armory: PEW PEW SHWOONNN BOOOM! That's the sound everyone loves to hear on their space platform, but you gotta produce those bullets and rockets don't you? Well here comes the Armory, 50% prod on all ammunition! (Unlocked after Metallurgic Science and Military 4)

# Nauvis:
- Atomic Enricher: Centrifuging with style and a obligatory 50% productivity. Can also produce more uranium related recipes and the new Uranium Sifting recipe, allowing you to search for U-238 and U-235 from stone! (Unlocked after Quantum Processors and Nukes)
- Lumber Mill: You know the drill by now, faster and 50% prod. This time with wood! Alongside it unlock new wood processes and Biomass, a cheaper alternative to Nutrients that spoils slower but gives less energy! (Unlocked after Tree Seeding)

# Gleba:
- Biochemical Facility: Hybridate pentapods and biters to satiate your desire for pain and suffering! This abomination can make most solid biological recipes without the need of eating! Why only solid when the machine is filled with fluids? Well... Uhm... The poor Pentapod-biter hybrid has a weak digestive system it'd feel bad if it drank something! :c Going back to the important stuff, only 25% prod! (Unlocked after Quantum Processors and Captive Biter Spawners)
- Greenhouse: Even the engineer has a green thumb! Or is it just pentapod blood? We may never know! This calm paradise in the factory's chaos can grow plants for you. 50% prod, the usual. Gleban products can only be grown there but wood on the other hand... let's just say there will be some more oxygen in space. It even has a related infinite tech! (Unlocked after the Lumber Mill and Cryogenic Science)
- Scrubber: This little machine will clean up all of your mistakes! Give it a catalyst and some water and it will clean up any atmosphere, only leaving some Waste Water for you to clean up! But your atmospheric trash is your own treasure! By cleaning the water you may get back some polluting products... (Unlocked after Agricultural Science, with additional recipes after unlocking Mineral Synthesis)

# Fulgora:
- Salvager: This upgraded Recycler doesn't just scrap the stuff you throw inside of it, it melts the components and then rebuilds them, sometimes with an higher quality than before! That's right, 10% quality recycler! (Unlocked after Quality Modules 3 and Carbon Fiber.)
- Petrochemical Facility: Another thing that always bothered me about Space Age is how after everything, you still gotta use Oil Refineries. Well that's where the Petrochemical Facility comes in! 25% prod and extra speed on all Oil refining, cracking, solid fuel... need anything else? It already has everything and more, including some new things... (Unlocked after Coal Liquefaction and Electromagnetic Science.)
- Advanced Assembling Machine: Assembler-er than ever! A faster assembling machine with 10% base productivity and low energy usage! (Unlocked after Productivity Module 3, Speed Module 3, Efficiency Module 3 and Automation 3. (Yikes!))

# Aquilo:
- Electromechanic Facility: This thing. It's huge. And it can make incredible stuff... 50% base QUALITY on all armors, equipment, vehicles and bots! It can also... well if you got here you might as well read the next lines. (Unlocked after Quantum Processors.)
- Hydraulic Plant: Ever thought producing Holmium Solution was too hard? Not anymore with a nice 50% prod over it. Same for all other fluid based recipes that aren't oil related or strictly cryogenic or electromagnetic! (Unlocked with Cryogenic Science.)
- Mineral Synthesizer: No metals on Aquilo? Not anymore! This special machine, fusion of a chemical plant and furnace, can synthesize the metals from the Ammoniacal Sea, alongside coal, calcite and stone synthesis! 20% prod and slightly faster than a chem plant! (Unlocked after Cryogenic Science and Air Scrubbing (For its synthesis recipes!))

# Beyond:
- Deep into interstellar space... shrouded in darkness... you may find new applications of those red fragments... (All unlocked after Promethium Science, Automation 4, Biolab and Electromechanics).
- Quantum Assembler: The final frontier of assembling. 100%. Productivity. On. All. Nauvis. Sciences. (+ Space Science). 
- Quantum Stabilizer: The final frontier of effect transmission. 8 Module Slots, huge affected area, 2X distribution efficiency, way too much power drain.
- Quantum Computer: The final frontier of research. 10% science pack drain, immense speed and many module slots. Extremely expensive and too dangerous to be built everywhere but in Space.

# Below:
- Perhaps our operations shouldn't have looked at the stars... (Unlocked after Promethium Science, Hydraulics and Electromechanics)
- Core Miner: Deep below the surface of our beloved planets (except Aquilo this guy stinks and has no solid surface!) lie endless resources for us to extract... Build the gigantic and expensive Core Miner to obtain Deep Minerals, to then process them into useful ores! Only one per surface, we wouldn't want to destroy a planet's core and the game's balance at once don't we?



# PLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS YOU FIND

## Compat:
### Addons (I think that's the term)
- [AoP Extended Planets](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/AoP-extended-planets): Moves around my new techs if some planet mods are installed.
### Built-in compat:
- [Foundry Restructuring](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/foundry-restructuring): Changes the crafting prototypes of the new recipes so that they can be made in my new machines alongside the changes from FR.
- [Vanilla Galore Continued](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vanilla_galore_continued) and [Space Age Galore](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/space_age_galore): Adds support for the recipes added by the mods to my machines.
- [5Dim's mod - New Automatization](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/5dim_automation): Makes crafting prototypes not broken.
- [Wooden Universe](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/wood-universe-modpack): Simply implements compat between AoP and some of the mods in the pack.
### Compat from other mods:
- [Extraplanetary Production](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/extraplanetary-production): Mod has support for my machines built in.

#### If your mod has compat for mine and I missed it, tell me! And if you want your mod to be compatible, just do it lol! If you need help tell me!!



### Future Plans:
- A trailer
- Adding more stuff maybe idk, you can suggest stuff.
- Compatibility with other mods.
- Currently adding some more buildings ;3.
#### Buildings on the way:
- Currently nothing! :3
#### Textures by Hurricane that probably won't be used.
- Thermal Plant
- Radio Station
- Conduit
- Item, Fluid and Electricity Extractors
- Train Loader (I recommend [this mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/train-loader) if you want it!)

This mod wouldn't be possible without the help of these amazing people!
