  So many fixes call me Fix-It Felix:

  Fixes:
    - Tried to fix compatibility issues with mods that add centrifuging recipes/crafting machines that do centrifuging.
    - Fixed Electromechanics requiring Promethium Science while being unlocked before it.
    - Tried to fix compatibility file with Foundry Restructuring, goes beyong me how it stopped working after the mod's release while it worked perfectly while testing.
